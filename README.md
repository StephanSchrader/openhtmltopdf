# OPEN HTML TO PDF

## OVERVIEW
Open HTML to PDF is a pure-Java library for rendering arbitrary well-formed XML/XHTML (and even HTML5)
using CSS 2.1 for layout and formatting, outputting to PDF or images.

Use this library to generated nice looking PDF documents. But be aware that you can not throw modern HTML5+ at
this engine and expect a great result. You must special craft the HTML document for this library and 
use it's extended CSS feature like [#31](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/31) or
[#32](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/32) 
to get good results. Avoid floats near page breaks and use table layouts.

## GETTING STARTED
+ [Templates for Openhtmltopdf](https://danfickle.github.io/pdf-templates/index.html) - MIT licensed templates that work with this project.
+ [Showcase Document - PDF](https://openhtmltopdf.com/showcase.pdf)
+ [Integration guide](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/wiki/Integration-Guide) - get maven artifacts and code to get started.
+ [Documentation wiki](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/wiki)
+ [Template Author Guide - PDF - DEPRECATED - Prefer wiki](https://openhtmltopdf.com/template-guide.pdf) - Moving info to wiki
+ [RC18 Online Sandbox](https://sandbox.openhtmltopdf.com/) - With more samples!
+ [Sample Project - Pretty Resume Generator](https://github.com/danfickle/pretty-resume)

## DIFFERENCES WITH FLYING SAUCER
+ Uses the well-maintained and open-source (LGPL compatible) PDFBOX as PDF library, rather than iText.
+ Proper support for generating accessible PDFs (Section 508, PDF/UA, WCAG 2.0).
+ Proper support for generating PDF/A standards compliant PDFs.
+ New, faster renderer means this project can be several times faster for very large documents.
+ Better support for CSS3 transforms.
+ Automatic visual regression testing of PDFs, with many end-to-end tests.
+ Ability to insert pages for cut-off content.
+ Built-in plugins for SVG and MathML.
+ Font fallback support.
+ Limited support for RTL and bi-directional documents.
+ On the negative side, no support for OpenType fonts.
+ Much more. See changelog below.

## FAQ
+ OPEN HTML TO PDF is tested with OpenJDK 8 and 11. We are [not currently testing with Oracle JDKs](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/10290). As of RC18, it requires at least Java 8 to run.
+ No, you can not use it on Android.
+ You should be able to use it on Google App Engine (Java 8 or greater environment). [Let us know your experience](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/179).
+ <s>Flowing columns are not implemented.</s> Implemented in RC12.
+ No, it's not a web browser. Specifically, it does not run javascript or implement many modern standards such as flex and grid layout.

+ Please start using the fast renderer (`builder.useFastMode()`) as the old renderer will be removed in a future version.
+ [#180](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/180) Fast renderer is finally ready for production. The fast renderer comes with:
  + Nearly 150 automated end-to-end regression tests. This is about 150 more than the old renderer.
  + Improved performance. This renderer scales linearly with the number of pages, compared to the old renderer which scaled with the page count squared.
  + Far better support for transforms, including nested transforms, multiple transforms and transforms interacting with hidden overflow, etc.
  + Better support for hidden overflow, with boxes now not escaping except with accordance to the standard.
  + Support for inserted cut off overflow pages. See [Cut-off page support](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/wiki/Cut-off-page-support) on the wiki.
  + Link areas and their hash link targets now repect transforms.
  + Bookmark targets now respect transforms.
  + Improved page placement for boxes. Now respects overflow and tranform properties.
  + Greater understanding which should make fixes and feature improvements easier.
+ Visual testing API is now available to use in the PDFBOX module. Please see [testing your PDF](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/wiki/Testing-Your-PDF-Document-Output) on the wiki. Thanks @red6.
+ [#333](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/333) Upgraded PDFBox to 2.0.14 and PDFBox-Graphics2D to 0.21.

+ [#326](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/326) Proper support for PDF/A standards with automatic regression testing. See [PDF/A Standards Compliance](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/wiki/PDF-A-Standards-Compliance) on the wiki.
+ [#328](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/328) SVG with `page` rule was crashing in certain circumstances.
+ [#324](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/324) Better logging with invalid or missing fonts.
+ [#320](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/320) NPE prevention in case of incorrect font configuration.
+ [a145329](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/commit/a145329aa03bab62725a883b3a5c05ffd49996c8) Were using incorrect font-metrics in certain situations.
+ [#303](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/303) Fixed: Table borders are partly transparent.
+ [#297](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/297) Fixed: Border not printed with "overflow: hidden".
+ [#304](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/304) Fix warnings for icon font without space inside PDF/A, add tests.
+ [#301](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/301) Make loading resources from classpath work when openhtmltopdf is a named module.
+ [#232](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/232) Were using JRE internal APIs.
+ [#289](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/issues/289) System.out.println("Getting image") in NaiveUserAgent.
